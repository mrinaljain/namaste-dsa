# Binary Search

Time complexity : O(Log N)
Space Complexity : O (1)
After dividing search space into 2 parts, if we can somehow discard 1 half of search space , using some conditions then we can apply binary search.

**Note**: *If we cannot discard one half of search space then we cannot apply binary search.*

Bro/Sis lost - police complaint analogy to understand in detail
 : Target (what to search ?)
 : Search Space (Where to search ?)




## Trick to solve question 
 -Can we Discard or Not one half  ?




 ### Question

 - why to land at center in binary search ?
   Because even in worst case we will discard half unuseful part of search space, but if we divede in any other ratio then we will be in risk of getting less space to dispose.
